## 🤖 ML Model: Medal Prediction

- Features used:
  - Sport, Discipline, Country, Gender
- Target:
  - Whether the athlete won a medal or not (`No Medal` vs `Medal`)
- Model:
  - Random Forest Classifier with class imbalance handling
- Output:
  - Binary prediction + probability (e.g., 87.5% chance of winning a medal)

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built using **Power BI** to visualize key trends in Olympic medal distributions.

- 🎯 Slicers for Year, Country, and Sport
- 🏅 Distribution by Gender, Sport, and Medal Type
- 🌍 Top countries by medal count
